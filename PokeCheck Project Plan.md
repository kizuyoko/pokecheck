# PokeCheck Project Plan
## API Integration
- **Source**: [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co)
- **Endpoints Used**:
  - `/pokemon/{name}` - Retrieve Pokémon data
  - `/type/{id or name}` - Retrieve type effectiveness data

## UI/UX Considerations
- **Typography**: Bungee (logo & title), Baloo 2 (body text)
- **Color Scheme**:
  - Background: #FFFBF4 (Floral White)
  - Card Background: #ffffff (White)
  - Text: #3b3b3b (Black Olive)
  - Primary Accent: #F5542E (Orange Red)
  - Secondary Accent: #1574B3 (Check Blue)  
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure usability on both desktop and mobile devices
